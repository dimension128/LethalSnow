#This plugin allows snowballs to do a configurable amount of damage. Either a random amount between two values or a direct static amount.
#You can configure many values in the plugin.yml file that this plugin generates for your server.
#However, all/most values are modifiable via in-game commands.

SnowBall: # Snowball config options
  DamageMin: 10 # Min damage a snowball will do.
  DamageMax: 20 # Max damage (You can set these two the same if you want static damage)
  DamageChance: 90 # The chance (0-100%) that a snowball will do damage at all.
  DamagePlayer: true # Can a snowball damage players?
  DamageMobs: true # Can a snowball damage mobs?
SnowMan: # 
  MaxSeedDrop: 20 # How many seeds can a snowman drop on death? This will be random up to this number.
SnowBiome: #
  ExhaustionMultiplier: 50 # A setting of around 30 is good imho. 100 is the max, and will cause people to get hungry pretty quickly.
